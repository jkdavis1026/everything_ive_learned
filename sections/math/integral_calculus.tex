This was one of the most challenging courses throughout school. It was challenging
because Integral's take no prisoners. I mean, there is literally a book that has
thousands of solutions to integrals that a human brain can't solve without a computer.


Many say that this was a "weed-out" course for aspiring computer scientists, but I digress.
This course was hard because it required me to push myself to do "just one more integral" when
I didn't want to see that hideous \(\int\) sign again.




\section{How it ended}
This was actually the first class that I got a C in. This was also the first class that
I was happy to get a C in.
