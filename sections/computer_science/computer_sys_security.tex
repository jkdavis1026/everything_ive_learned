\chapter{Computer System Security}
I took this class in the Fall of 2025 with a notably "poor" professor named
Randall "Randy" Klepetko and let me tell you... I really need to stop reading the reviews
about professors on RateMyProfessor because he was anything but "poor". To paint a picture
of Dr. Klepetko, go to a Grateful Dead concert and pick any long haired, maybe late fifty's,
tall skinny dude out of the crowd, and I'd say they might be a spitting image of him. I mean
this in the absolute best way possible; he literally would be at that concert, and it may
very much be him. The reviews said things along the lines of "he's rude to students", or
"his tests are impossible". While I've never heard him be rude to a student, I can say that
the tests were inherently challenging due to the nature of the courses he taught (this one and
Computer Architecture). So main takeaway from this course? Don't believe what you read on the
internet, especially if it's written by a frustrated 18-year-old who couldn't ChatGPT their
way through the course.

So what is this course? It's a very high level of understanding what Computer System Security
is and understanding some of the threats that machines (computers) are exposed to.
