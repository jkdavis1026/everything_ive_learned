\chapter{What Went Right}

This title is pretty self-explanatory, no? Here I log what went wrong in my journey
and my attempt at understanding why.

\section{Group Projects}
Yup. Not working in them, but the quality of students that school had. Every single
group project that I was a part of, there was one or two students who showed up at
10pm the night of the deadline to make sure their name was on the paper so they could get
the grade.
